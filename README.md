![overview](https://github.com/RajLabMSSM/isoMiGA/raw/main/isomiga_schematic.png)


The isoMiGA project combines long-read and short-read RNA-seq from microglia cells purified from post mortem human brains.

Using an atlas of novel isoforms, we show that microglia use a range of isoforms in response to stimulation and can differentiate microglia from different brain regions.

We then map genetic associations with isoform usage and other types of RNA splicing, observing that multiple GWAS variants act through novel microglia isoforms in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
